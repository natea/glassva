This project was built in 72 hours during the [Dreamforce Hackathon 2013](http://events.developerforce.com/dreamforce/hackathon)

It consists of a Google App Engine app, a Salesforce APEX app, 
and a middleware running on Heroku which sends and receives messages from the Google Glass user.

The code used for this is based on the Mirror Quickstart for Python
